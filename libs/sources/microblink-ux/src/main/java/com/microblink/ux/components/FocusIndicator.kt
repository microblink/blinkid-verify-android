 * them stays clearly visible no matter what is behind the control, which is
 * what keeps focus readable on top of the live camera preview and on both
 * light and dark surfaces.

 * showing and hiding them never shifts the surrounding UI. Apply this modifier
 * before any `Modifier.clip` in the chain so that the indicator is not clipped
 * away by the control's own shape.
